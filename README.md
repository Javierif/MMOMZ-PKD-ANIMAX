## Important
This code is currently in testing on [Guaranpis](https://guaranpis.es/) and is still under development. 

:warning: You Have to support PKD patreon (see below) in order to access to the RPG Maker `Animax` plugin 
> I work with the v.1.2 of the PKD plugin
 
An official RPG Maker MZ licence is also required. 

> Community members said that the `MZ core v1.2` is compatible but the *core v1.5 is not*. 

## Requirements
1. [MMORPG Maker MZ](https://github.com/Andaroth/MMORPGMaker-MZ) code from the `master` branch
2. The whole ABSZ engine & requirements from [Phoenix Kage Desu's Boosty](https://boosty.to/kagedesu)

## Installation
1. Download `Alpha ABSZ` plugin from Phoenix Kage Desu's patreon and install it in your project

2. Copy the files from our `MMOMZ-PKD-ANIMAX/modules/player` to your MMORPG Maker MZ project `server/modiles/player` folder, override the old ones

3. Copy the files from our `MMOMZ-PKD-ANIMAX/js/plugins` to your project `js/plugins` folder and activate them in the Plugins Manager

4. Its important Plugin MMO_Core_Animax is a position under PK_ANIMAX plugin

5. Now your animations will be in sync!
